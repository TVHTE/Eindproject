# day 1
I have been ill today, so no further comments until tomorrow.

# day 2
The network data is in the right format and I succeeded to plot a graph (view below). The module colours are also correct. The graph is draggable at the moment. However I want to limit the amount of drag, because it diminishes the layout of the network and modularity of it. I also worked on getting the data in the right format for the heatmap. I did not yet succeed in this.
I first want to get it working and after that make decisions on further design choices.
