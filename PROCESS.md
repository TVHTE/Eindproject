# day 1
I have been ill today, so no further comments until tomorrow.

# day 2
The network data is in the right format and I succeeded to plot a graph (view below). The module colours are also correct. The graph is draggable at the moment. However I want to limit the amount of drag, because it diminishes the layout of the network and modularity of it. I also worked on getting the data in the right format for the heatmap. I did not yet succeed in this.
I first want to get it working and after that make decisions on further design choices.

# day 3
I succeeded in getting the right format for the heatmap. I also implemented with connectivity strengths (view below). There is a little bug with the 90th node and I also plotted it on a different tab of the website. This to ensure it is totally functional before I connect it with my network.

# day 4 
Because of the code red - storm I lost a lot of time on my project. I will make up for this, this weekend. Therefore I was not able to have all visualizations for the deadline tomorrow morning. Nevertheless I will ensure, the time-loss will not be an issue for the project. 
For the deadline, my network visualization is on the graph tab and my heatmap on the heatmap tab.
