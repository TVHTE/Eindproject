# day 1
I have been ill today, so no further comments until tomorrow.

# day 2
The network data is in the right format and I succeeded to plot a graph (view below). The module colours are also correct. The graph is draggable at the moment. However I want to limit the amount of drag, because it diminishes the layout of the network and modularity of it. I also worked on getting the data in the right format for the heatmap. I did not yet succeed in this.
I first want to get it working and after that make decisions on further design choices.

# day 3
I succeeded in getting the right format for the heatmap. I also implemented with connectivity strengths (view below). There is a little bug with the 90th node and I also plotted it on a different tab of the website. This to ensure it is totally functional before I connect it with my network.

# day 4 
Because of the code red - storm I lost a lot of time on my project. I will make up for this, this weekend. Therefore I was not able to have all visualizations for the deadline tomorrow morning. Nevertheless I will ensure, the time-loss will not be an issue for the project. 
For the deadline, my network visualization is on the graph tab and my heatmap on the heatmap tab.

# day 5
Made a barchart for next to the graph with tooltip

# day 6
Implemented all graphs on 1 webpage. Worked on a rewriting the graphs to a function, and for an update function later on. Not yet finished. Created the dropdown for selecting dataset. Not functional yet.

# day 7
Had some problems with the dropdown. Tried to consider making both graphs and using show and hide with the dropdown. However, that did not work properly yet. Forgot to commit to GitHub yesterday so did this first thing in the morning.

# day 8
The dropdown did not work for both datasets, that is why I chose to show both graphs simultaneously. In hindsight, I should've chosen this option earlier, because it is actually better to compare the two datasets next to eachother. Forgot again to commit to GitHub yesterday, so did this first thing in the morning.
